He was grateful to get back on the court with his players for their first game in six days, believing that sports can provide a small uplift to an exhausted city.</p><p>“I think a group functions best when you draw strength from each other, and the way my players, my staff, the organization has supported, rallied around me, rallied around the city … there’s real strength in that,” Redick said. “That’s the receiving of strength. Then it’s our job to go give strength and give hope and give joy. Sports are a lot of things, and sports can certainly provide an escape and a distraction. Hopefully sports tonight can provide some joy as well.”</p><p>The NBA postponed two home games for the Lakers and one home game for the Clippers last week while the fires still raged. The NFL also moved the Los Angeles Rams’ wild-card playoff game against Minnesota to suburban Phoenix on Monday night.</p><p>Redick said some of his players had been under an evacuation warning in recent days, and one couldn’t make it to work on time because of activity around his home. Redick and his family lost almost everything they owned in their rented home.</p><p>“I’ve been overwhelmed with the amount of support and love and generosity that people have shown to me and my family, and really all families that have been affected by this,” Redick said.</p><p>The Lakers staged a donation drive outside their arena before they hosted the Spurs, accepting food and packaged personal items. The Lakers and Clippers were among 12 Los Angeles-area pro sports teams that announced Monday they will contribute more than $8 million combined for local relief efforts.</p><p>The Lakers displayed the message “Thank you first responders” on their scoreboard before the game and observed a moment of silence before point guard Gabe Vincent spoke to the crowd.</p><p>“On behalf my teammates, this organization, our hearts go out to all those who have been affected by this,” Vincent said. “We’d definitely like to give a shoutout to the first responders who are putting their lives on the line right now to protect our community. I think it’s important at this time that we come together as a city, as a community, as a family, to help support those that are in need right now.”</p><p>The Clippers covered every seat at Intuit Dome with giveaway white towels featuring the words “LA Strong” and a blue image of the state of California.</p><p>“We’re so thankful for the first responders, but we ache for the victims,” public address announcer Eric Smith said before the game. “The smoke will lift and they will return and rebuild, because this is LA. Today we all stand together (as) one team, one Los Angeles.”</p><p>The two teams’ opponents also went through several days of uncertainty due to the wildfires.</p><p>The Spurs were supposed to play back-to-back games against the Lakers starting Saturday. The Heat, who will face the Lakers on Wednesday, didn’t know if they would be allowed to head to Los Angeles last Saturday until after their game in Portland.</p><p>“We understand our responsibility,” Miami coach Erik Spoelstra said. “We want to do whatever we can in this profession. We’re coming with great empathy and grace, and if our role is to provide entertainment and inspiration, then that’s our role. But while we’re doing that, we’re thinking about all the devastation and all people are dealing with.

While he is not the type of director who presents a powerfully charismatic public image like Hayao Miyazaki, he is definitely a hardcore master who has worked in animation in post-war Japan since its early days.</p><p>This book — “1-byo 24-koma no Boku no Jinsei,” literally “My life at 24 frames per second” — is the Japanese edition of his autobiographical manga first published in France in early 2024 as “Ma Vie en 24 Images par Seconde.” The term “24 frames per second” comes from the fact that anime is usually displayed at 24 frames every second.</p><p>Rintaro is known for bringing into his animation a production style noted for a sharp contrast between light and shadow, something he learned from his film-loving father.</p><p>The book begins during the childhood of Shigeyuki Hayashi (Rintaro’s real name). Born in the year of Japan’s attack on Pearl Harbor, he evacuates from Tokyo to a village in the countryside. When he is 8 years old, he becomes fascinated by the magic of films that he sees at a traveling cinema. His first employer is Toei Doga Co. (the predecessor of Toei Animation Co.) The company invites Osamu Tezuka to produce an animated film, but Tezuka clashes with its staff and resigns.</p><p>Rintaro then leaves Toei Doga to join a new production studio created by Tezuka and devotes himself to the production of “Tetsuwan Atom” (“Astro Boy”), Japan’s first domestically produced TV anime series. Tezuka’s production studio is a revolutionary place that overturns accepted “common sense” related to animated expression, while at the same time it is a place of pandemonium every day and night.</p><p>“Tetsuwan Atom” is ridiculed as an electric kamishibai (picture-story show) by the staff of Toei Doga because the number of drawings per second is kept to a minimum. The merits and demerits of “Tetsuwan Atom” in this respect remain a matter of debate today, but there are many fascinating scenes which could only have been drawn by Rintaro, a man who knows both production studios. A case in point is Tezuka’s humorous and ghoulish appearance, which Rintaro witnesses up close. This alone makes this manga a first-rate historical document. I have watched almost all the animated works that appear in this manga book in real time, many of which were directed by Rintaro. Oftentimes I felt quite embarrassed with an inner cry of, “Oh, so that was Rintaro’s work, too!”</p><p>It is food for thought that the book was originally published not in Japan but in France, as a bande dessinee, a French-style graphic novel. According to an afterword included in the book, Rintaro took six years to draw this manga in place of a failed animated adaptation of his autobiography that a French animation company had tried to produce.</p><p>Now it is apparent that Rintaro’s reputation as an animation director is much higher in France than in Japan. It would have been impossible in Japan to get approval for a proposal to publish Rintaro’s autobiographical manga in such a luxurious format (an A4-sized hardcover), which I find frustrating. For this reason, I also feel that this “reverse publication of a translation” is a very significant event.</p>', 'images/10_theJapanNews.jpg', 'Rintaro’s Autobiographical Manga', 5, 2, 4, '2025-02-06 13:00:00', '2025-02-06 13:00:00'),

This is called unisexual reproduction.</p><p>While mammals are known to reproduce only through sexual reproduction, certain other vertebrates including some reptiles, amphibians, birds and fish have produced offspring using unisexual reproduction. These have involved a phenomenon called parthenogenesis in which an embryo forms from an egg without fertilization.</p><p>In the new study, mice were created through genetic editing of mouse embryonic stem cells targeting a class of mammal-specific genes known as imprinted genes, of which there are about 200, the researchers said.</p><p>Stem cells are cells that can develop into various bodily tissues. Embryonic stem cells, present in early-stage embryos, have the capability of developing into all the cell types of the developing fetus. Most kinds of stem cells are less versatile and may help to sustain and restore only the tissues and organs in which they are situated.</p><p>The researchers said they modified 20 of the imprinting genes and used cloning technology in order to create the bipaternal mice.</p><p>“Generally speaking, imprinted genes have been thought to serve as a ‘lock’ preventing mammals from undergoing unisexual reproduction. However, this widely accepted hypothesis had not been conclusively proven before,” said developmental biologist Wei Li of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, who helped lead the study.</p><p>“This is a fundamental science study focused on animal models. There are no plans to extend this type of experimentation to humans,” he added.</p><p>The researchers created 1,081 embryos. Of those, about 12% survived to birth, much lower than normally would be the case.</p><p>A total of 84 male and 50 female pups were born. More than half died before reaching adulthood. Those reaching adulthood all had developmental defects, experienced a shortened lifespan and were sterile.</p><p>“The bipaternal mice exhibited developmental disorders, including craniofacial deformities, where their facial width-to-length ratio was broader compared to normal mice. They also had difficulty suckling,” said developmental biologist and study coauthor Guan-Zheng Luo of Sun Yat-sen University.</p><p>The researchers devised a way to significantly alleviate those two defects by inactivating a specific developmental gene.</p><p>“However, the mice still exhibited behavioral abnormalities, such as a tendency to enter the center of an open-field test, which is contrary to the instinctive behavior of rodents, who typically prefer to stay near the edges. The sterility of the bipaternal mice may be due to excessive modifications of imprinted genes, as these regions play various roles in development,” Luo added.</p><p>This is the latest research involving bipaternal laboratory mice.</p><p>A team of scientists led by developmental biologist Katsuhiko Hayashi of Osaka University in Japan used a different technique in research published in 2023 to create bipaternal mice by turning skin cells into what are called induced pluripotent stem cells, which can transform into any cell type.</p><p>“The main difference between their work and ours,” Hayashi said of the new study, “lies in the use of genome editing for generating offspring.”</p><p>Hayashi said his team’s method does not involve genome editing, except in a minor way, and all the pups derived from this technique have grown into adults without premature death.</p><p>“That said, this report makes a significant contribution to a deeper understanding of the function of genomic imprinting in mammalian development and reproductive technologies,” Hayashi said.</p><p>Developmental biologist Zhi-kun Li of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, first author of the new study, said it represents “a notable accomplishment in mammalian genetic engineering.” He said the technique used in this study enhanced the pluripotency — the ability to develop into numerous cell types — of embryonic stem cells, which he said play a critical role in regenerative medicine.</p><p>“For endangered species, this technique provides a potential method for producing offspring through unisexual reproduction, without relying on complex stem cell differentiation processes,” he added.</p>', 'images/11_theJapanNews.jpg', 'Mice in Box', 2, 2, 4, '2025-02-06 12:00:00', '2025-02-06 12:00:00'),

Once inside these groups, the content can spread rapidly.</p><p>&quot;Because these spaces are more closed off, they make it harder for the public to accidentally come across the material, which means we receive fewer reports about this type of distribution.&quot;</p><p><b>Hosting patterns</b></p><p>In 2023, CSAM was traced to 56 different countries which is 12 more than 2022 and the greatest number on record according to the report.</p><p>The research suggests that this could be indicative of a wider distribution of CSAM or due to the greater number of confirmed CSAM cases reported to Hotline.ie.</p><p>Nineteen of the 56 were countries in the European Union.</p><p>These accounted for nearly a third of all confirmed CSAM, 22% of which was traced to image-hosting services operating in Slovakia.</p><p>There were 21 incidents of confirmed CSAM hosted in Ireland, with an average removal time of less than a day from the time that Hotline.ie received the report.</p><p>The number of confirmed cases of CSAM hosted in Ireland remains low year to year, with a drop from 34 incidents in 2022 according to the report.</p><p>However, it does note that distribution patterns are &quot;only a snapshot in time&quot; - indicative of where the CSAM was hosted on the internet and not an indication of the level of CSAM production, consumption, or commercialisation within any one jurisdiction.</p>', 'images/17_rte.jpg', 'Hands on Laptop', 4, 3, 2, '2025-02-06 13:00:00', '2025-02-06 13:00:00'),

The LDP also called for revising the law concerning information distribution platforms, among other measures.</p><p>The ruling and opposition parties have agreed to revise the Public Offices Election Law during the current Diet session, by adding a provision that would seek to increase integrity in election campaign posters.</p><p>Some people have made large profits by posting election-related content on social media. The LDP regards this as problematic. “[Such acts] have weakened the efficacy of deposit fees in preventing a glut of candidates, and there is a discrepancy with the principle that those who are involved in election campaign activities should work as volunteers,” the party stated in the set of topics.</p><p>In its call to revise the law on information platforms, the party also claimed that the law has no clause to immediately halt misinformation even when such information is spread on social media.</p><p>Other topics for discussion include a rise in content that does not abide by the Public Offices Election Law, which requires that contact information, such as an email address, be displayed. Also at question is how to respond to the difficultly of monitoring and correcting irregularities during elections.</p><p>Additionally, the ruling party urged measures against those who run in elections to support another candidate, rather than to try to get elected themselves. “It must be said that such candidacies are unfair and inappropriate,” the party said.</p><p>A draft of the revision to the Public Offices Election Law that would support integrity in election campaign posters was also presented at the meeting. It would require posters to clearly show candidates’ names, and introduce a fine of up to ¥1 million on those using the posters for commercial ads or promotions.</p><p>The ruling and opposition parties plan to submit a draft bill to revise the law to the Diet by the end of this month, and aim to pass the bill by March.</p><p>The new provision on posters would have a one-month notification period, and is expected to apply to the Tokyo metropolitan assembly election in June and the House of Councillors election this summer.</p>', 'images/18_theJapanNews.jpg', 'City in Japan', 3, 2, 5, '2025-02-04 01:30:00', '2025-02-04 01:30:00'),

The Los Angeles Rams will be the home team for that game, part of a multi-year commitment to play in Melbourne.</p><p>“This is a big statement,” league executive Peter O’Reilly said. “Probably a few years ago, you may not have thought this was a reality. I’d say the commissioner, the 32 owners, there’s a commitment to become a true global sport property. That means expanding our footprint, that means going to different parts of the world and exposing more fans around the world, in this case fans in Australia and Melbourne, to our great sport.”</p><p>O’Reilly said the game will likely be played in Week 1 to give the teams extra time to acclimate to the time zone and promote the sport before the game. It would likely be scheduled for prime time on the East Coast of the United States, which could mean a start time of about noon in Melbourne.</p><p>The NFL opened an academy in Australia last year to help develop promising teenagers in the Asia-Pacific region into college and pro prospects. The Super Bowl being played Sunday in New Orleans features Australia’s most successful NFL player: Philadelphia Eagles left tackle Jordan Mailata.</p><p>The Rams have had marketing rights in Australia since the NFL started its international marketing program in 2022.</p><p>“We could not be more excited,” team President Kevin Demoff said. “As soon as this opportunity came about, we were the first to raise our hands and say we want to play in that first game in Australia.”</p><p>The NFL hopes committing to Australia will help boost the chances that flag football will be part of the 2032 Olympics set to be held there in Brisbane. Flag football will make its Olympic debut in Los Angeles in 2028 and a decision on whether it will be part of the 2032 Olympics will be made in the next few years.</p><p>Australia will be the seventh country outside the United States to host an NFL game. The league has played games in England annually since 2007 and has also played games in Mexico, Germany, Brazil and Canada. The Miami Dolphins will be the hosts for the first game in Spain in 2025 at Real Madrid ‘s venue.</p><p>As of the 2025 season, the NFL can schedule up to eight league-operated regular-season games internationally.</p><p>London will host three games next season — two at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium and one at Wembley Stadium. The Browns and the New York Jets are the home teams at Tottenham; and the Jacksonville Jaguars at Wembley.</p><p>The Colts are the home team for a game in Berlin at Olympic Stadium, and the other game will be in Madrid.</p><p>O’Reilly also said the league is committed to return to Mexico after renovations to Azteca Stadium for the 2026 World Cup are finished.</p><p>This won’t be the first time a major U.S.-based sports league went to Australia with Major League Baseball playing a season-opening series between the Los Angeles Dodgers and Arizona Diamondbacks in Sydney in 2014.</p><p>There have also been several major college football games played in Australia over the years, with the most recent being games between Stanford and Rice in 2017 and California and Hawaii in 2016.</p>', 'images/19_theJapanNews.jpg', 'Australian Stadium', 4, 1, 3, '2025-02-06 13:00:00', '2025-02-06 13:30:00'),
(20, '‘My five-year-old can now talk fluently in Irish’: Inside the Irish language school in a loyalist heartland', 'Inside the Irish language school in a loyalist heartland', 1, '<p>It was a pile of rubble on a vacant site in a loyalist east Belfast heartland up until two months ago.</p><p>Today sunlight streams through the windows of a bright pink-and-green tiled building at the site – a former textile factory that had lain derelict for a decade. “Fáilte” is spelt out on bunting above its entrance. Inside there are nursery schoolchildren from Naíscoil na Seolta setting out plastic plates for their banana, kiwi and blueberry morning snack. “Maidin mhaith,” they scream at the top of their voices when we enter the room.</p><p>This is the Irish language school that sparked protests by a group representing loyalist paramilitaries last year.</p><p>Members of the Loyalist Communities Council (LCC) – with links to paramilitary groups the UVF, UDA and Red Hand Commando – were granted a private meeting with Stormont’s education minister, the DUP’s Paul Givan, and urged him to halt construction work on the nursery school, arguing its presence would cause “polarity and volatility” in the community.</p><p>Threats and intimidation followed, with a large banner opposing the school erected on fencing at the Montgomery road commercial site, an incident treated as a “sectarian hate crime” by police.</p><p>The Irish Times has been invited to Scoil na Seolta – school of the sails, owing to the area’s maritime history – a fortnight after staff and 18 children from the Naíscoil moved into their new premises from their previous base in a church hall.</p><p>Construction workers are measuring up for a fence ahead of grass being laid, a wild flower garden is planned for the back yard and a soft play area is to be installed; when workers came on site last August the foundations of the former Ulster Weavers building were all that remained.</p><p>Plant pots with each child’s name are sprouting muscary, a tiny bluebell-like flower, and crocus outside their new classroom. The seeds were planted before Christmas, and pupils are watching them grow under the sunlight.</p><p>In September Scoil na Seolta will make history when it becomes east Belfast’s first integrated Irish-medium primary school. Numbers will be small but more than 150 expressions of interest have already been received from families for the next five years.</p><p>The building is also a temporary one, with the long-term plan to move to a permanent site – Van Morrison’s former school Orangefield High is earmarked for development.</p><p>“Not one penny” for the £750,000 project has come from Stormont’s Department of Education, says Methodist minister and chair of the school’s board Andrew Irvine. Funding for the capital build was provided by the Irish government’s Shared Island Fund.</p><p>“Therefore there is nothing being diverted away from other children. This is fresh additional money,” Irvine adds.</p><p>In an area once a bastion of unionism, where an almost exclusively Protestant workforce staffed the Harland & Wolff shipyard, the school has become a symbol of east Belfast’s significantly altered political landscape and demography.</p><p>It is a “language project and it’s also a reconciliation project; that’s what keeps me here”, says Claire Mitchell, a writer from a Protestant background who also sits on the school board.</p><p>Despite an outpouring of public support – 1,500 emails were received by the board in one weekend – there was anxiety ahead of their first open day. Anonymous leaflets were posted to homes in the area, asking “do you want an Irish language school in your area?” Instead dozens of families arrived – including those from loyalist and unionist backgrounds.</p><p>The school’s founder, Linda Ervine, smiles broadly when she says “there was no trouble”.</p><p>“We only opened for two hours on the Saturday morning for our open day because it was still chaos from the move; we had two families waiting to get in and then it went all quiet. We thought ‘oh no’, and then the next thing it was like a tsunami. Over 40 families turned up and then there were more afterwards - people who couldn’t make it came privately during the week. We were run off our feet.”</p><p>An English secondary schoolteacher from a Protestant background who grew up in a loyalist working class area of east Belfast, Ervine was introduced to Irish in 2011 and says it changed her life. She set up the Turas Irish language project over a decade ago that led to creation of the Naíscoil in 2021.</p><p>The sister-in-law of the late Progressive unionist Party (PUP) leader, David Ervine, and wife of Brian Ervine, who also led the party, she describes the moment she entered the new school building last month as “very emotional”.</p><p>“We had this pie in the sky idea about having a school in 2017. Within four years it had become a reality. Then it was in a church hall, now we have a building.”</p><p>Mitchell pays tribute to Ervine’s determination in seeing through the project while being subjected to online abuse. “She’d be making the sausage rolls at the school parties, there’s no notions about her. She is so modest. Such grit,” says Mitchell.</p><p>Ervine acknowledges that the abuse can be “tough” but her biggest concern is the parents.</p><p>“For me it is hard when people attack you on social media but quite often they’re faceless nameless people. It’s when it’s people you know, people who I once regarded as friends, even some family members as well unfortunately. I wasn’t frightened by the intimidation, I was more concerned about how it would impact on families.”</p><p>Overwhelming support within the PUL (Protestant unionist Loyalist) community has far outweighed the negativity, she adds. “People come up to me in the street and they say, ‘I think what you’re doing is wonderful’.”</p><p>In an area where educational attainment is low – particularly among Protestant working class boys – Ervine wants to promote the “benefits of bilingualism”.</p><p>“It’s not a one size fits all. I know this will not be the choice for every parent but it’s another opportunity to improve,” she says.</p><p>Parent Natalie McDowell agrees. Both she and her husband are from a Protestant background and live in east Belfast. They decided to send their daughter Méabh to the Naíscoil two years ago because of the “integrated aspect, first and foremost”.</p><p>“Then there was one day she was talking to a room full of adults completely in Irish, she wasn’t using any English. The confidence falls out of her,” says McDowell. “Sending her here was the best decision we could ever have made with all the lovely experiences she had. She got to walk in the St Patrick’s Day parade, celebrated the queen’s last Jubilee and king’s coronation – she celebrated so much that Northern Ireland has to offer.</p><p>“I’m amazed at my little five-year-old who now can talk fluently in Irish. People have said to me, ‘what about her English?’ Her P1 teacher has told me her English is now very advanced. It hasn’t held her back. Méabh has no understanding that anyone could think speaking Irish is a negative thing.”</p><p>Back in the classroom the school’s manager and teacher Ciara Moore is doing a countdown in Irish with the nursery pupils clearing the table after their snack.</p><p>The Limerick-born Trinity graduate says her family were “super worried” when she took the job last August “I was worried too. When the LCC stuff came out, Linda rang me on my way to work and my stomach just dropped ... but the outpouring of support has been incredible.”</p><p>Moore, who has a degree in French and Irish and is currently studying for a Master’s degree in special educational needs, becomes animated when she speaks about the first child in the class to put a sentence together in Irish.</p><p>“The child is French and used the word ‘im’, the Irish for butter, in a full sentence ... none of us had taught that. It was last September and I have it in an observation. I was like, ‘this is what we’re about, language and linguistics and kids understanding’.</p><p>“If we learn about and understand other people – that makes for such good communication. Everyone in this area does not have to learn Irish but being bilingual is the biggest gift.”</p><p>Outside parents and grandparents are arriving to take their children home.</p><p>Linda Ervine looks out the window at them, smiling. “We knew that once it was up and running parents would come on board. Even if we had only two children here we would pursue it. We’re invested in this, we’re pushing ahead – we have to. It’s going to happen.”</p>', 'images/20_theIrishTimes.jpg', 'Children in Primary', 5, 5, 1, '2025-02-05 12:00:00', '2025-02-05 12:40:00');
